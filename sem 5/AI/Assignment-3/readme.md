Look at the classical water-jug problem and its solution in the below link:
https://www.vtupulse.com/artificial-intelligence/water-jug-problem-in-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=Water%20Jug%20Problem%20Definition%2C,a%204%2Dliter%20jug.%E2%80%9D

Write a Python program to solve the water-jug problem using breadth-first search. Inputs to the program should be 1. Capacity of two jugs, and target measurement. Target measurement is the unit user wants to get as a solution.

Intermediate output shall be properly displayed. For example, you can find a sample in this link:
https://www.includehelp.com/ml-ai/water-jug-problem-in-artificial-intelligence.aspx This intermediate output shall be written in an output file.

Things to upload:
1. Downloaded colab .ipynb files
2. Output files
3. Small write-up on the process used to solve the problem.
